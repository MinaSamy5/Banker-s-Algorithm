# Banker's Algorithm
This is a project which implements banker's algorithm. Banker's algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm used to detect whether a system is safe or unsafe. This project simulates the banker's algorithm and takes the used step by step towards building a system of processes and resources checking whether a deadlock occurs in that system or not.
